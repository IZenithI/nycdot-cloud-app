## Entries and District Lookup  
### The District Lookup portion allows admins to look up a district and see all of the entries that are present with that section. This can be done by entering the district into the textbox. The entries can be double clicked to expand into their respective forms where their attributes may be edited. The green indicator on an entry shows whether that entry has been saved by you.
